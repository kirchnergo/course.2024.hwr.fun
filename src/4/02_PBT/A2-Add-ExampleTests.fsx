// ===============================
// Requirements:
// * Implement a function that adds two numbers together

(*
Me: Hey Garfield, we need a function that adds two numbers together,
    would you mind implementing it?

Garfield: Done!

Me: Thanks, let me write a quick test.

// ===============================
// test of implementation 1

(*
Me: That looks great. Let me do a quick code review as well.

Me: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(*
Me: Hey Garfield, *I'm* going write the tests first from now on.
    Can you make sure they pass?

Garfield: Sure!

// ===============================
// test of implementation 2

Me: Thanks, Garfield. All tests pass!

Me (thinking): Let me just check the implementation again.

Me: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(*
Me: Garfield, what are you even doing?
    You haven't implemented anything at all,
    you're just making the tests pass.

Garfield: Chill out dude, I'm totally following TDD best
     practices.

     "Write only enough production code to make the
     failing unit test pass."

Me: Ok, let's try one more time.
